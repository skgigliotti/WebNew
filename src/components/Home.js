        <p>
          I am a senior at Westmont College in Santa Barbara, CA. I study Computer Science and Spanish
          and am always looking for ways to combine these two fields. I have a strong math background and professional experience
          working with databases and Salesforce. I am currently working as an intern at EF Education First in 
          Boston, MA. I get to work on improving and developing technology for student travelers.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am commited to ethical computing and am passionate
          about seeking justice through technology and otherwise.

          When I am not programming or reading great Spanish literature, you'll find me running, taking photos,
          or knitting.
